# Boost.Interprocess

### common interprocess communication and synchronization mechanisms
- shared memory
- memory-mapped files
- semaphores, mutexex, condition variables and upgradable mutex types to place them in shared memory and memory mapped files
- named versions of those synchronization objects, similar to UNIX/Windows sem_open/CreateSemaphore API
- file locking
- relative pointers
- message queues

### higher-level interprocess mechanisms to allocate dynamically portions of as shared memory or a memory mapped file
- dynamic creation of anonymous and names objects in a shared memory or memory mapped file
- STL-like containers compatible with shared memory/memory-mapped files
- STL-like allocators ready for shared memory/memory-mapped files implementing several memory allocation patterns (like pooling)

### sharing information between processed
- file
- kernel of the operating system
    - message queue
- memory region
    - shared memory
    - memory-mapped file

### persistence of interprocess mechanisms
- process-persistence
- kernel-persistence
- filesystem-persistence

## IPC mechanisms
- mutex, semaphore, condition, shared memory, pipe: anonymous and named
- memory mapped file, file lock, message queue
