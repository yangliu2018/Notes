# 1. Introdution


# 2. The PAC Learning Framework
- PAC: probably approimately correct

## 2.1 The PAC learning model
- X: input space, the set of all possible examples or instances
- y: the set of all possible labels or target values
- binary classification: y = {0, 1}
- i.d.d.: independently and identically distributed
- learning problem
- generalization error
- empirical error
- PAC-learning
